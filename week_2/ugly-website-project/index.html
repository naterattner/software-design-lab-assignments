            In 2023, the Mets entered the season with the largest payroll in baseball and expectations to compete for a championship. They will finish the season with a losing record and without many of their star players, who they traded away midseason.

        <p>
            This is the just the latest chapter in a long history of embarassing Mets sagas.

        <h3>Here are some of the most notorious Mets seasons in the team's 61-year history:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1962: </strong>In their first-ever season, the Mets go 40-120, posting one of the worst records ever</li>
            <li><strong>1993: </strong>Mets lose 100 games for the fierst time since 1967</li>
            <li><strong>2006: </strong>Mets' best hitter watches strike 3 go by to lose NL Championship series</li>
            <li><strong>2007: </strong>With 17 games left in the season, the Mets blew a seven-game NL east lead</li>
            <li><strong>2008: </strong>Same thing as the year before but a 3.5 game lead</li>
            <li><strong>2023: </strong>Pay players a lot, win a little</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>One of the best Mets flubs is a contract agreement with former player Bobby Bonilla</h3>
        <p>
            As part of a deferred salary arrangement, the New York Mets have paid Bonilla about $1.19 million on each July 1 since 2011. They will continue to do so until 2035, when Bonilla is 72. This is why we celebrate <strong>"Bobby Bonilla day"</strong> every July 1.

        <h3>The rare moments that make it all worthwhile</h3>
        <p>
            There are not many times when being a Mets fan is a rewarding endeavor. May 7, 2016 was one of those times.
        </p>
        <p>On this fateful day, a 42-year-old pitcher known as "Big Sexy" came to the plate hitting .089 for his career. With a smile on his face, Bartolo Colon hit his first career home run, a feat that has to be seen to be believed:</p>
